So, this is the Heapsort algorithm implemented with a priority queue.. well actually both
a min- and max-priority queque is implemented. Thats why there are two files, with almost 
identical code: maxPQHeap.java and minPQHeap.java. The only difference is that all 
comparisons is reversed.

Run Heapsort.java to try it out. 
(if you run the program from an IDE, write your numbers in the console followed by a 'go' command.
